Method 1
 We do a DFS traversal of the given graph. For every visited vertex ‘v’, if there is an adjacent ‘u’ such that u is already visited and u is not parent of v, then there is a cycle in graph. If we don’t find such an adjacent for any vertex, we say that there is no cycle.
 
 Method 2
 Union and find
 For each edge, make subsets using both the vertices of the edge. If both the vertices are in the same subset, a cycle is found.
 
 Method-3 for directed graphs
Depth First Traversal can be used to detect cycle in a Graph. DFS for a connected graph produces a tree. There is a cycle in a graph only if there is a back edge present in the graph. 
Back edge is an edge that is from a node to itself (selfloop) or one of its ancestor in the tree produced by DFS. 
Implementation:
two arrays -> visited[V], inStack[V]
iteratively call(loop) function that does{//Done in order to insure we dont have a disconnected graph
Mark the current node as visited and part of recursion stack
Recur for all the vertices adjacent to this vertex{
if(not visited recusrively call function that does)
else(if visited check if present in stack then cycle detected)
}
}
